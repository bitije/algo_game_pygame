# Algo game
An offline 2d game using python (pygame, pytmx).

In this game you can play as a spy who explores the station and stumbles upon mysterious algorithms.

In the process, he has to figure out how they work and get out of the station.

## My goal
I started this project to get a better understanding of how the classic algorithms work and try to visualize them in the game.

Because when I was a kid I really wanted to make my own game, it turned out to be a lot harder than I thought...

## How to play 
1. Clone rep
``` git clone git@github.com:vojdelenie/algo_game_pygame.git ```

2. Install python, then pygame and pytmx
``` python -m pip install pygame pytmx ```

3. To start game double click on ``` algo_game.py ```

4. ???

5. Profit
